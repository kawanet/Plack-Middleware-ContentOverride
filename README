NAME
    Plack::Middleware::ContentOverride - Override Request Content Body by
    File Uploading or Query Parameter

SYNOPSIS
    In your Plack app:

        use Plack::Request;

        my $app = sub {
            my $env  = shift;
            my $req  = Plack::Request->new($env);
            my $type = $req->content_type;
            my $body = $req->content;
            ...;
        }

        use Plack::Builder;

        builder {
            enable 'ContentOverride';
            $app;
        };

    Payload as an uploaded file overrides the request content body:

        <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data" action="...">
            <input type="file" name="payload">
        </form>

    Payload as a query parameter overrides the request content body:

        <form enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded" action="...">
            <textarea name="payload"></textarea>
        </form>

DESCRIPTION
    This allows a payload sent from a HTML form to override "Plack"'s
    request content body. This would help you to run a RESTful app through
    traditional HTML forms.

    A couple of payload styles are available: 1. file uploading and 2. query
    parameter.

  File Uploading
    For an app which receives a binary content of JPEG, PNG, etc. including
    a larger content, use "method="POST"" and
    "enctype="multipart/form-data"" to perform a file uploading.

  Query Parameter
    For an app which receives a text content of JSON, XML, etc., "textarea"
    element would work fine.

CONFIGURATION
    This middleware accepts the following configuration keys.

        enable 'ContentOverride', payload => 'body', content_type => 'application/xml';

  payload
    This specifies a request query parameter which contains a new content
    body. Default name is "payload".

        enable 'ContentOverride', payload => 'payload'; # default

  content_type
    This specifies a new content type. Default type is
    "application/octet-stream".

        enable 'ContentOverride', content_type => 'application/octet-stream'; # default
